        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_01_01" v="Planting the same crop every year (monoculture or monocropping) leads to a reduction in yield."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_01_02" v="Depending on the type of soil and crop the amount lost varies between 5 and 25 percent of the expected yield. Different crops require different nutrients in the soil to grow."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_01_03" v="Crop rotation is a system of growing different types of plants with different requirements on the same field across multiple seasons. This gives the soil the time needed to supplement missing nutrients that are usually contained in leftovers from previous harvests, but are not yet in a form appropriate for plants to utilize."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_01_04" v="Pests and pathogens tend to be specialized for a specific kind of plant. Rotating crops decreases the likelyhood of pests and diseases surviving between growth cycles and infecting the next crop by removing their hosts and allowing the soil to clean itself from pathogens specific to particular crop types."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_01_05" v="Crop rotation performed well, prevents soil from loosing nutrients that plants require for growth, and greatly reduce disease and pest presence. All this leads directly to higher quality and quantity of yield in subsequent years."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_02_01" v="To prevent yield losses due to pests and pathogens a certain time period should be maintained between planting the same type of crop in a given field"/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_02_02" v="Canola, sunflower, potatoes and sugar beets can return after two growth periods."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_02_03" v="Most cereals, soybeans, sugar cane and cotton require at least a one year gap."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_02_04" v="Corn, grass and poplar can be grown every year, but a yield reduction due to the depletion of nutrients in the soil must be taken into account."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_03_01" v="Some plants grow better or worse after others."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_03_02" v="Crops within the same group have similar demands, thus you should avoid planting them one after another in the same field."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_03_03" v="For instance, cereals and oilseeds grow very well after legumes. Roots grow well after cereals. Canola or sunflowers can grow very well after sugar beets."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_03_04" v="The two previous crop categories have the dominant effect on the current yield."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_03_05" v="For best results the crop rotation planner in the game menu can be used to choose the order and type of crops."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_04_01" v="A field may also be left fallow, without planting for full year. The soil will then regain the ability to support even the most demanding crops."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_04_02" v="Yearly fallow applies only when seasonal growth is enabled in game options."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_05_01" v="In the field info box additional entry show the crop rotation efficiency and two previous crops."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_05_02" v="Crop rotation efficiency is the percentage of increase (when over 100%) or decrease (when less than 100%) in yield."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_05_03" v="Perfect crop rotation allows to receive an additional 15 percent of yield."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_05_04" v="Ignoring crop rotation may result in 30 percent of yield lost."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_05_05" v="Field info box elements:
        A. currently growing crop
        B. previous crops from newest to oldest
        C. overall performance with description and yield bonus/loss
        D. After harvest the harvested crop is placed in the first entry of the previous crops and the last entry is forgotten." />
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_06_01" v="If the Precision Farming mod is in use, the crop rotation efficiency becomes one of the ingredients of the final yield estimation, and is added to the Precision Farming info box."/>
        <e k="cropRotation_helpText_06_02" v="Crop rotation efficiency is now part of the yield potential alongside the variables nitrogen, pH, soil type, seed rate and weeds"/>
